# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site, that catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

I then used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL and created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. I then made a bubble chart that displays each sample and the sample metadata as an individual's demographic information.

I then made it possible to display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page and update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
